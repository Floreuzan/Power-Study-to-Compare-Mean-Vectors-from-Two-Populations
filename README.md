# Power Study to Compare Mean Vectors from Two-Populations

We considere two populations with the assumptions:


We compare mean vectors from two populations when:

* (4) Both populations are not multivariate normal distributed
* (5) when the covariance matrices are different.

We construct a power study that estimates the power and type-I error of the approximate test when the assumptions are not met.

You can find the shiny apps in the visualization files where you can control for the mean vector, the distribution and for the covariance matrix.
